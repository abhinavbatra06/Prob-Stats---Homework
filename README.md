## Question 1: Three Random Variables

**Problem Statement**:  
If a random variable \( \tilde{w} \) is positively correlated with another random variable \( \tilde{y} \), and \( \tilde{y} \) is positively correlated with a third random variable \( \tilde{z} \), can \( \tilde{w} \) and \( \tilde{z} \) be negatively correlated? If no, prove it. If yes:  
(a) Provide an example of three such random variables.  
(b) Provide a small sample of data with three variables such that the three sample correlations have this property. Compute and provide the data and the sample correlation matrix of your data.

## Question 5: Temperature Analysis

**Problem Statement**:  
The table in `temperature.csv` includes the average temperatures of each month at different locations (longitude and latitude).  

(a) Create a scatterplot of latitude and longitude of the 2000 locations (using a natural choice of which variable to assign to the x-axis). Calculate the minimum and maximum latitudes in the dataset and make a plot of the marginal distribution of latitude. Does the distribution of locations appear to be a random sample of Earthâ€™s spherical surface?  

(b) Make scatterplots of the latitude and temperature data and compute the correlation separately for January and July. Is there a natural justification to choose one variable for the x-axis and the other for the y-axis? Why?  

(c) Describe what you find both within and between each scatterplot and compare the two correlations. Hypothesize on what could explain any noteworthy differences found.  

(d) Compute the correlation between latitude and temperature in July for the locations in the southern hemisphere (latitude < 0). Plot scatterplots and the linear MMSE estimator and corresponding residuals.  

(e) Repeat the experiment for locations in the northern hemisphere (latitude > 0) in January.  

(f) Explain your findings in the previous part. What do you notice? Hypothesize some explanations.
