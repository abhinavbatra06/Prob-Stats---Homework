Question : 1 (Three random variables) If a random variable ˜ w is positively correlated with another
 random variable ˜ y, and ˜ y is positively correlated with a third random variable ˜ z, can ˜ w
 and ˜ z be negatively correlated? If no, prove it. If yes,
 (a) provide an example of three such random variables;
 (b) provide a small sample of data with three variables such that the three sample
 correlations have this property. Compute and provide the data and the sample
 correlation matrix of your data


Question : 5  (Temperature) The table in tempature.csv includes the average temperatures of each
 month at different locations (longitude and latitude).
 (a) Create a scatterplot of latitude and longitude of the 2000 locations (using a natu
ral choice of which variable to assign to the x-axis.) Calculate the minimum and
 maximum latitudes in the dataset and make a plot of the marginal distribution of
 latitude. Does the distribution of locations appear to be a random sample of earth’s
 spherical surface?
 (b) Make scatterplots of the latitude and temperature data and compute the correlation
 separately for January and July. Is there a natural justification to choose one variable
 for the x-axis and the other for the y-axis? Why?
 (c) Describe what you find both within and between each scatterplot and compare the
 two correlations. Hypothesize on what could explain any noteworthy differences
 found.
 (d) Compute the correlation between latitude and temperature in July for the locations
 in the southern hemisphere (latitude < 0). Plot scatterplots and the linear MMSE
 estimator and corresponding residuals.
 (e) Repeat the experiment for locations in the northern hemisphere (latitude > 0) in
 January.
 (f) Explain your findings in the previous part. What do you notice? Hypothesize some
 explanations
